### Project Name:Portfolio

## Get start

- First, you need to create a new repository for this exercise, and start working in a 'feature' branch.
- Do not re-use your portfolio code! As you will see, using Bootstrap you will barely need to write any CSS, just use Bootstrap classes.
- Install Bootstrap in your project, including both CSS and JS files.
- Start prototyping the desktop version of the portfolio.
- Explore all the Bootstrap components to see which ones you may need. For this exercise you don't need to personalize them to adjust to the design template
Here is a list of some components that could be useful
